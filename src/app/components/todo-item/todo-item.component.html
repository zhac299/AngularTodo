<! -- 
this html is added to the app.component.html file as page renders
the same thing is done for all components.

ngClass lets us set a function which runs on the tag which it
is attached to.

a event is added to a tag via () for instance in the input tag:
<input (change)="onToggle(todo)" ... /
the even is the (change) and so when the input changes the
function onToggle is run with a parameter of todo passed to it.
same thing for the button click event, (click).
--> 
<div [ngClass]="setClasses()">
    <p>
        <input (change)="onToggle(todo)" type="checkbox" />
        {{ todo.title }}
        <button (click)="onDelete(todo)" class="del">x</button>
    </p>
</div>
